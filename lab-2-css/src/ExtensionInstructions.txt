In the example, there is some CSS already in place which selects parts of the document using element selectors, classes, and pseudo-classes. Make the following changes to this CSS:

Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS color keyword hotpink.
Give the heading a 10px dotted border-bottom which uses the CSS color keyword purple.
Make the level 2 heading italic.
Give the ul used for the contact details a background-color of #eeeeee, and a 5px solid purple border. Use some padding to push the content away from the border.
Make the links green on hover.
